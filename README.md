Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm an Electronic Engineer turned Software Developer with a passion for Functional Programming. Iâ€™m a strong advocate of TDD, BDD, and Agile methodologies.

 ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a custom [Scalatest](https://www.scalatest.org/user_guide) [Reporter](https://www.scalatest.org/scaladoc/3.0.5/org/scalatest/Reporter.html) to be used during the execution of a [FeatureSpec](https://www.scalatest.org/scaladoc/3.2.19/org/scalatest/featurespec/AnyFeatureSpec.html) specification, to capture, show and search all the browser screenshots captured during the execution of the specification itself â€¦ sort of live documentation.
You can see the project [here](https://github.com/robertom-binqua/scalatest-featurespecs-screenshots-reporter).
Of course, this is the Scala part of it(... I am trying to write it in Scala 3.6.4 but IntelliJ it is too slow... but I did not give up), but there is also the report itself built in [React](https://react.dev). 
You can find the Report project [here](https://github.com/robertom-binqua/scalatest-react-report). All is under construction.

ðŸŒ± What I am learning/studying/investigating at the moment?

1. Moving to Scala 3 ... finally.
2. Always an eye on Haskell and Cats libraries ecosystem.
3. React and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) because I think typeless language should not exist ;-).
4. Some AI courses on Coursera:
   1. [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/W8VEX2UINGAD)
   2. [Structuring Machine Learning Projects](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/W8VEX2UINGAD)
   3. [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/DW61TFBVRU1Y)
5. Java 21 ... I know :-(
